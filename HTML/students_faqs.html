				<dt>How do I know whether or not a course meets a UCORE requirement?</dt>
				<dd>
				<p><strong>UCORE courses are all identified by a bracketed three- or four-letter abbreviation in the <a title="View the WSU course catalog online" href="http://catalog.wsu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WSU course catalog</a></strong> indicating which requirement the course satisfies. Abbreviations are as follows:</p>
				<p><code>[ROOT]</code> = Roots of Contemporary Issues</p>
				<p><code>[QUAN]</code> = Quantitative Reasoning</p>
				<p><code>[WRTG]</code> = Written Communication</p>
				<p><code>[COMM]</code> = Communication</p>
				<p><code>[SSCI]</code> = Inquiry in the Social Sciences</p>
				<p><code>[HUM]</code> = Inquiry in the Humanities</p>
				<p><code>[ARTS]</code> = Inquiry in the Creative and Professional Arts</p>
				<p><code>[BSCI]</code>, <code>[PSCI]</code>, &amp; <code>[SCI]</code> = Inquiry in the Natural Sciences</p>
				<p><code>[DIVR]</code> = Diversity</p>
				<p><code>[CAPS]</code> = Integrative Capstone</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>How many UCORE courses can be taken within my major?</dt>
				<dd>
				<p><strong>A maximum of three (3- or 4-credit) UCORE courses may be taken for UCORE credit</strong> <span class="has-tool-tip span-is-source blue"><strong>within your major</strong></span><span class="is-qtip">Additional Notes|A UCORE course is within your major if it is offered by the same academic department/unit that administers your major. For example, if you are a mathematics major, then any course within the WSU catalog that has a course prefix of MATH is considered within your major.</span>. For the purpose of this limitation, three 1-credit courses may be combined to count for a single 3-credit course.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Can my UCORE courses be taken pass/fail?</dt>
				<dd>
				<p><strong>While courses designated as a University Common Requirement (UCORE) technically can be taken on a pass/fail basis, they will not satisfy UCORE requirements under this condition.</strong> All UCORE-designated courses must be letter-graded (i.e., A, B, C, D, and F) to satisfy UCORE requirements (with a couple of exceptions).</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>How many <em>Communication Proficiency</em> requirements are there?</dt>
				<dd>
				<p><strong>Two courses in <em>Written/Communication Competencies</em> are required.</strong> One must be [WRTG] typically fulfilled with English 101 or the student&#8217;s placement writing course. The second course can be either [COMM], or a second [WRTG] course.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>What about Honors Students?</dt>
				<dd>
				<p><strong>Honors students complete the <a title="Read through the requirements for Honors Students listed on the Honors College website." href="https://honors.wsu.edu/requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Honors College requirements</a></strong> outlined in the Honors section of the WSU course catalog.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Are <em>Writing in the Major</em> (or &#8220;<code>[M]</code>&#8220;) courses required in the UCORE curriculum?</dt>
				<dd>
				<p><strong>Two <code>[M]</code> courses must be taken to satisfy a <a title="Learn more about all of the graduation requirements" href="/students/graduation-requirements/">University-wide graduation requirement</a></strong>, although they are not specifically part of the UCORE curriculum.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Can I take a CAPS course while studying abroad?</dt>
				<dd>
				<p><strong>Effective Fall 2019, students must take CAPS courses in residence.</strong> “In residence” means a course either taught on a WSU campus or taught by WSU faculty, wherever the course may be located. Transfer and study abroad courses are not suitable for fulfilling the capstone requirement.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>What are the Science requirements?</dt>
				<dd>
				<p><strong>The Science requirements are a little more complex than other UCORE requirements; here&#8217;s how they work:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>All students must take a minimum of 7 credits. Those in the College of Arts and Sciences must take 8.</li>
					<li>All students must have one course in Biological Sciences [BSCI] and one course in Physical Science [PSCI].</li>
					<li>All students must have a least one lab course; students in the College of Arts and Sciences must have two lab courses.</li>
					<li>Completion of the sequence of both Science 101 and Science 102 will fulfill the complete science requirements ([BSCI], [PSCI], and 2 labs). Note that the completion of only one course in the sequence will not fulfill [BSCI] or [PSCI] on its own.</li>
				</ul>
