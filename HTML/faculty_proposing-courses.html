<p class="article-tagline">Prospective UCORE courses must be approved through a formal proposal process.</p>
<p>Below is a list of the basic required information for UCORE course proposals. Instructors, please also note:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="/resources/handbook/">UCORE handbook:</a></strong> consult the handbook for details, including specifics about requirements for the particular course category (e.g., HUM, QUAN, CAPS) and for requirements for all UCORE courses.</li>
	<li><strong>Note: CAPS courses have additional requirements</strong> as outlined in the Handbook. In additon, <a href="https://atl.wsu.edu/teaching-resources/hutchings-workshop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resources for designing capstone assignments</a> are available from ATL.</li>
	<li><strong>Syllabus Checklist:</strong> review the current <a href="/documents/2017/08/syllabus-checklist_from-wsu-vpue.pdf"> <em>Syllabus Checklist</em></a> for requirements, recommendations, and additional resources related to course planning and syllabi. This document is updated annually, to provide up-to-date language for current required policy statements, as well as resources to assist faculty. Additional information is available on the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education’s <a href="https://vpue.wsu.edu/policies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">policies page</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Sharepoint submission:</strong> the course proposal submission process is electronic through a <a href="https://sharepoint.ir.wsu.edu/sites/ir/UCORE/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UCORE SharePoint site</a>. <strong>Detailed instructions for uploading course proposals to SharePoint are provided <a href="#sharepoint-instructions-panel">in the section below</a>.</strong> If you need access to the SharePoint site, please email Jeannie Holt at <a href="mailto:jmholt@wsu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jmholt@wsu.edu</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="course-proposal-materials-panel" class="drop-down-toggle boxed">Course Proposal Materials (updated 2013)</h3>
<div class="toggled-panel initially-hidden">
	<ol>
		<li>A UCORE Course Proposal form. <br />
			<span class="has-smaller-text">(<strong>Please note:</strong> these are specially streamlined versions.)</span>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="/documents/2017/01/ucore-new-or-converted-course-change-form.pdf">UCORE New Course/Converted Course Change Form</a></li>
				<li><a href="/documents/2017/01/ucore-new-or-converted-capstone-course-change-form.pdf">UCORE New Capstone Course/Converted Course Change Form</a></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>A detailed course syllabus, which must include:

			<ol>
				<li>Details specified in the “Guidelines for Syllabus Creation at WSU” (link), including the UCORE Category designator</li>
				<li>Detailed prompts for key graded assignments, especially writing assignments (e.g., For each major paper students must write, the contents and purpose of the paper will be specified in detail.)</li>
				<li>Statement of which learning goals — university learning goals, course-specific, and (if applicable) program-specific learning goals — the course will advance. To “advance” a student toward a learning goal means that by the end of the course, each student (who passes the course) will have a greater ability, as specified by the goal, than the student had when beginning the course. Students should have practice with feedback in order to improve their ability.

					<ol>
						<li><strong>Note:</strong> Do not choose too many learning goals for your course, or else the course may be spread too thinly. You must choose those learning goals assigned to the course (see <a href="/resources/handbook/">UCORE handbook</a> for Required Contents for Specific Categories of UCORE courses), and you may choose some beyond that, but do not attempt all of them. Also make sure that the learning goals in the syllabus are consistent with the rationale, and that the UCORE learning goals are integrated into the activities of the course as listed in the syllabus, and not just cut and pasted into the syllabus.</li>

<h3 id="sharepoint-instructions-panel" class="drop-down-toggle boxed">How to Upload Course Proposals to SharePoint</h3>
<div class="toggled-panel initially-hidden">
	<p>For access to SharePoint, please email Jeannie Holt at<a href="mailto:jmholt@wsu.edu"> jmholt@wsu.edu</a>.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Check your current browser version and ensure it is <a href="http://www.webdevelopersnotes.com/latest-browser-versions" target="_blank" title="Resource that lists the latest versions of popular web browsers">up to date</a>.</li>
		<li>Save the cover sheet, rationale, and syllabus as a single document whose filename is the course prefix and number. e.g. PHIL 101. If the course is entirely new to the catalog, add "NEW" to the course number. e.g. PHIL 100 NEW. <br>&nbsp; <br><strong>NOTE: It is important that just a single document be uploaded.</strong> Either Word documents or PDFs are acceptable, but PDFs will enable you to skip a second log-in. Word will prompt you for the username/password in order to open its own connection to SharePoint, whereas the Adobe plug-in will do so automatically. <br>&nbsp; <br>If you have already filled out a cover sheet, and do not have the software to combine the files into one document, you can send them to Jeannie Holt (<a href="mailto:jmholt@wsu.edu">jmholt@wsu.edu</a> ) who will return them to you as a single PDF. It is important that you upload them personally so as to get the appropriate notifications.</li>
		<li>Open the Sharepoint site in your web browser: <a href="https://sharepoint.ir.wsu.edu/sites/ir/UCORE/default.aspx" target="_blank">https://sharepoint.ir.wsu.edu/sites/ir/UCORE/default.aspx</a></li>
		<li>Log in under the Active Directory domain using your Network ID (e.g., you would type in <strong><code>ADyournetworkID</code></strong> as your user name; including the <code>AD</code> sets the login domain to Active Directory) and your usual network password.</li>
		<li>The home page should be called "UCORE Course Approvals" and consist of a Task bar and a Course Proposals bar in the center of the page.</li>
		<li>Click on the blue text that says "+ new document". <strong>NOTE:</strong> Do not use the "drag files here" option.</li>
		<li>You will be transferred to a page whose first section is "Create a new File."Scroll down and select "UPLOAD EXISTING FILE".&nbsp; Click on the "Browse" button and locate your document.&nbsp; Leave the Destination Folder blank.&nbsp; You can add comments if you like.&nbsp; Click the "OK" button.</li>
		<li>In the next "Edit Item screen," you can update the properties of the document. Choose the appropriate College, Department and UCORE Category. Make sure the Course Proposal Status is "Awaiting College Approval."</li>
		<li>You may add comments. These will be visible to reviewers down the line and remain visible throughout the approval process when the document is displayed. Click "Save" to proceed.</li>
		<li>That's it!</li>
