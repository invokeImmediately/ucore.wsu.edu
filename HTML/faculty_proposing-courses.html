			<h2>Proposing New UCORE Courses</h2>
			<p>For each of WSU&#8217;s baccalaureate students, the UCORE component of their degree provides the breadth of learning that complements more focused study within the major. The balance of breadth and depth in every degree reflects the recognition that effective leaders in all fields of work draw on a breadth of knowledge and skills from a variety of disciplines. In addition, UCORE courses merit particular attention for several other reasons. UCORE courses may comprise a student&#8217;s full course load in their first semester or first year at the university. In many cases, the particular UCORE course that a student takes in a given designation will be the only college-level course taken from that disciplinary perspective. For these non-majors, UCORE courses not only introduce students to the specific topic of a given course but also to the modes of inquiry, evidence, and critical thought that govern the wider disciplinary arena. Ultimately, all UCORE classes should focus clearly on the development of student learning. They  should enhance the knowledge, skills, and abilities as articulated in the WSU Learning Goals and Outcomes, which encourage the development of lifelong learning skills of integrating and synthesizing concepts in order to solve real problems.</p>

			<div class="toggled-panel">
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Getting started</strong> (for department chairs/undergraduate studies committee chairs):
						<ol class="sv--0mx" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
							<li><strong>Review the current <a href="https://ucore.wsu.edu/faculty/resources/handbook/">UCORE Handbook</a></strong> for updated information about the Learning Outcomes for the course’s intended UCORE designator and other elements needed for UCORE courses/syllabi. Identify specific outcomes that the course fulfills. Note that each designator has specific sets of required outcomes.</li>
							<li><strong>Communicate with department faculty or staff</strong> to determine (1) who has been teaching this course (if previously taught without UCORE designation) in recent years and (2) how syllabi and expectations are communicated to instructors.</li>
							<li><strong>Determine whose responsibility</strong> it will be to collect and prepare proposal materials.</li>
							<li><strong>Communicate submission deadlines</strong> and other relevant information and/or materials as necessary.</li>
							<li><strong>Department chairs should review and sign off</strong> on (initial) prepared submission materials when ready (see step 3 below).</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Preparing materials</strong> (for undergraduate studies committees/faculty):
						<ol class="sv--0mx" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
							<li><strong>Review the current <a href="https://ucore.wsu.edu/faculty/resources/handbook/">UCORE Handbook</a></strong> for updated information about the Learning Outcomes for the course’s intended UCORE designator and other elements needed for UCORE courses/syllabi. Identify specific outcomes that the course fulfills. Note that each designator has specific sets of required outcomes.</li>
							<li><strong>Communicate with other instructors across all sections on all campuses</strong> where the course is currently offered (if course is not entirely new) to collect recent syllabi and representative assignment prompts that fulfill the Learning Outcomes for the course’s UCORE designator.</li>
							<li>For multi-section and/or multi-campus courses, <strong>form a steering committee or regular working group of faculty (if not already in place) involved in the course to ensure consistency and communication of learning outcomes</strong>. Expectations are that UCORE learning outcomes and the means to achieve them are apparent and similar across all sections and campuses, but that faculty may adopt varied assigned readings, assignments, topics, activities, etc as they see fit. Consider the extent to which syllabi and assignments are in sync to advance the UCORE learning outcomes <em>before the course is submitted for UCORE designation</em>. Reconcile any divergences before submitting the new UCORE course proposal. Moving forward, all faculty that may teach the course in the future will have a clear sense of the expectations.</li>
							<li><strong>Develop a master syllabus</strong> that includes (1) clear language about the course&#8217;s place within and value of UCORE to students&#8217; undergraduate experience, (2) a completed Learning Outcomes Grid for this course (see <span style="color: #0000ff">sample UCORE syllabus</span>), and (3) up-to-date required components per WSU&#8217;s <a href="/documents/2018/08/syllabus-components-checklist_from-wsu-vpue_2018.pdf"><em>Syllabus Checklist</em></a>.

Also consult the <span style="color: #0000ff">sample UCORE syllabus</span>.</li>
							<li><strong>Select a representative assignment prompt</strong> to include in the proposal package. In some cases, key assignment prompts and assignment descriptions in syllabi will require revision from previous iterations if the course has been taught in the past. Consult the Office of Assessment of Teaching and Learning&#8217;s <a href="https://atl.wsu.edu/assignment-design/">Assignment Design </a>webpage for assistance.</li>
							<li><strong>Download and complete the <span style="color: #808080;text-decoration: underline">proposal form</span></strong> in full (see forms linked below under &#8220;Required Course Proposal Materials.</li>
							<li><strong>Assemble</strong> the completed (1) <span style="color: #808080">proposal form,</span> (2) master syllabus, and (3) representative assignment prompt into a single PDF file. Title the file as follows: Course Prefix_Course Number_UCORE Designator</li>
							<li><strong>Ask your department chair to review the proposal and sign off.</strong></li>
							<li>After approval, <strong>share the final proposal package with all instructors</strong> currently or potentially teaching the course. Use it as a training or orientation tool for any instructors teaching the course in the future.</li>

					<li>A detailed master syllabus that includes the following components:
						<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
							<li><strong>Clear language about the course&#8217;s place within UCORE, </strong>including how the course fulfills learning outcomes for its specific UCORE designation and value of UCORE to students&#8217; undergraduate experience. For instance, the syllabus for a Diversity [DIVR] course should clearly address how the course helps students move beyond perception-based comparisons, understand how power, privilege, stereotypes are constructed and sustained, etc. Social Science [SSCI] syllabi should not only address how the course fulfills disciplinary learning outcomes, but does so within the context of UCORE&#8217;s [SSCI] requirements, including the use of quantitative reasoning. The <a href="https://ucore.wsu.edu/faculty/resources/handbook/">UCORE Handbook</a> contains required elements for each UCORE designation. For sample UCORE syllabus language, consult the <span style="color: #0000ff">[sample UCORE syllabus]</span>.</li>
							<li><strong>A completed Learning Outcomes Grid</strong> for the course’s specified UCORE designation that explicitly spells out which UCORE, course, and (if applicable) program learning goals the course will advance. To “advance” a student toward a learning goal means that by the end of the course, each student that passes the course will have a greater ability, as specified by the learning goal, than the student had when beginning the course. Students should have practice with feedback in order to improve their ability. Grids for each designator can be downloaded, completed, and inserted as follows: [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_arts.docx">ARTS</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_bsci.docx">BSCI</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_caps.docx">CAPS</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_comm.docx">COMM</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_divr.docx">DIVR</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_hum.docx">HUM</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_psci.docx">PSCI</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_quan.docx">QUAN</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_ssci.docx">SSCI</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_wrtg.docx">WRTG</a>]</li>

			<h2>Revising Existing UCORE Courses</h2>
			<p>Revising courses that hold UCORE designation may or may not require review by the UCORE Committee depending on the nature of the change. Regardless, all curricular changes must be initiated through the Office of the Registrar. The process will not begin with the UCORE committee. Please <a href="http://curriculumchange.registrar.wsu.edu">visit the registrar&#8217;s curriculum change website</a> for appropriate steps and required major and minor curricular change forms.</p>
			<p>The UCORE Committee will review the following Major Curricular changes requested through the Office of the Registrar. The request will then move on to the Catalog Subcommittee of Faculty Senate for review:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Change to subject (course prefix)</li>
				<li>Change to course number</li>
				<li>Increase in course credits</li>
				<li>Change in variable or repeat credit</li>
				<li>Addition of conjoint status (note: UCORE CAPS courses cannot hold conjoint status)</li>
				<li>Revision to grading type (note that students cannot receive UCORE credit if a UCORE course is taken pass/fail)</li>
				<li>Revision to lecture/lab ratios</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The UCORE Committee will not review Minor Curricular changes to courses that hold UCORE designation. Minor Curricular changes must still be requested through the Office of the Registrar, which will then forward the request to the Catalog Subcommittee of Faculty Senate for review. Minor changes include:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Title changes</li>
				<li>Catalog description changes</li>
				<li>Prerequisite changes</li>
				<li>Addition or removal of cross-listing</li>
				<li>Addition or removal of University of Idaho cooperative status</li>
				<li>Credit reduction, including reduction in variable or repeat credit</li>

			<h2>Renewing UCORE Courses</h2>
			<p>All courses that hold UCORE designation are required to undergo periodic renewal to ensure that they continue to meet general education learning outcomes at WSU. The UCORE committee periodically revises UCORE Learning Outcomes based on latest national best practices, assessment data, university policy initiatives, and other criteria. Therefore, departments seeking renewal should carefully adhere to the following steps to ensure that courses successfully renew UCORE status. Recognizing that courses evolve over time, your department is welcome to request renewal of the course under a different UCORE designator, if you find that is a better fit.</p>
			<h3 id="renewal-process-goals" class="drop-down-toggle boxed">Goals for UCORE Course Renewal</h3>
			<div class="toggled-panel">
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Ensure that UCORE courses on all campuses contribute as expected to advance WSU’s Seven Learning Goals</strong>, helping to confirm that the university offers a coherent general education curriculum through which students can develop a breadth of knowledge and range of skills.</li>
					<li><strong>Communicate the value to students</strong> and other stakeholders of a broad general education that complements depth of study within major programs.</li>
					<li><strong>Confirm department ownership of and responsibility for their UCORE courses:</strong>
						<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
							<li>Departments develop appropriate infrastructure for consistency and regularity of UCORE course offerings.</li>
							<li>Faculty regularly review and update syllabi to align with UCORE learning goals and outcomes.</li>
							<li>New instructors know when they are teaching a UCORE class and they have access to recent syllabi and assignments.</li>
							<li>Faculty assess student learning and share/discuss results, to help refine UCORE courses and assignments.</li>
							<li>Departments improve UCORE courses and instruction over time; periodically correcting syllabus drift.</li>
							<li>Faculty responsible for UCORE courses regularly communicate within and across campuses, including for multi-section courses.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Ensure that courses approved are periodically reviewed and updated to meet current UCORE requirements</strong> at an appropriate level of rigor.</li>
					<li><strong>Value diverse approaches to course design and teaching</strong>, leveraging the unique strengths of each campus, discipline, faculty, and students, within UCORE’s framework for general education.</li>
					<li><strong>Give commendations</strong> – recognize strong samples and practices.</li>

				<ol>
					<li>A completed UCORE course <a href="/documents/latest-course-renewal-form">renewal form</a>.</li>
					<li>A detailed master syllabus that includes:
						<ol class="sv--0mx" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
							<li><strong>Clear language about the course&#8217;s place within UCORE,</strong> including how the course fulfills learning outcomes for its specific UCORE designation and value of UCORE to students&#8217; undergraduate experience. For instance, the syllabus for a Diversity [DIVR] course should clearly address how the course helps students move beyond perception-based comparisons, understand how power, privilege, stereotypes are constructed and sustained, etc. Social Science [SSCI] syllabi should not only address how the course fulfills disciplinary learning outcomes, but does so within the context of UCORE&#8217;s [SSCI] requirements, including the use of quantitative reasoning. The <a href="https://ucore.wsu.edu/faculty/resources/handbook/">UCORE Handbook</a> contains required elements for each UCORE designation. For an example, consult the <span style="color: #0000ff">[sample UCORE syllabus]</span>.</li>
							<li><strong>A completed Learning Outcomes Grid</strong> for the course’s specified UCORE designation that explicitly spells out which UCORE course, and (if applicable) program learning goals the course will advance. To “advance” a student toward a learning goal means that by the end of the course, each student that passes the course will have a greater ability, as specified by the learning goal, than the student had when beginning the course. Students should have practice with feedback in order to improve their ability. Grids for each designator can be downloaded, completed, and inserted as follows: [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_arts.docx">ARTS</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_bsci.docx">BSCI</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_caps.docx">CAPS</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_comm.docx">COMM</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_divr.docx">DIVR</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_hum.docx">HUM</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_psci.docx">PSCI</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_quan.docx">QUAN</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_ssci.docx">SSCI</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_wrtg.docx">WRTG</a>]</li>
							<li><strong>Up-to-date Syllabus Components:</strong> Review the current <a href="/documents/2018/08/syllabus-components-checklist_from-wsu-vpue_2018.pdf"><em>Syllabus Checklist</em></a> for requirements, recommendations, and additional resources related to course planning and syllabi. This document is updated annually, to provide up-to-date language for current required policy statements, as well as resources to assist faculty. Additional information is available on the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education’s <a href="https://vpue.wsu.edu/policies/">policies page</a>.</li>

					</li>
					<li><strong>A representative assignment prompt</strong> that faculty teaching the course agree advances the required learning outcomes for the course’s UCORE designation. Consult the Office of Assessment of Teaching and Learning&#8217;s <a href="https://atl.wsu.edu/assignment-design/">Assignment Design webpage</a> for assistance.</li>

				<p>New UCORE renewal Sharepoint site still under development. For Spring 2019 pilot courses, please submit single PDF file to Jeannie Holt at <a href="mailto:jmholt@wsu.edu">jmholt@wsu.edu</a>. Website will be operational before Fall 2019 and submission instructions will appear here.</p>

			<h3 id="renewal-submission-deadlines" class="drop-down-toggle boxed">Renewal Submission Deadlines</h3>
			<div class="toggled-panel">
				<p>The UCORE Committee has organized the first round of renewals to take place over four years from Fall 2019 through Spring 2023. Renewal will take place in the approximate order in which courses were originally approved.</p>
				<p>Consult the <a href="http://ucore.wsu.edu/documents/2019/02/ucore-renewal-schedule-prefix-view.pdf">UCORE renewal schedule</a> to see when to submit specific courses for renewal. Courses that are not submitted by the deadline listed in the renewal schedule will lose UCORE status within two semesters. For example, a course not submitted by Fall deadline would not hold UCORE designation beginning the following Fall semester. If you do not intend to renew a particular course&#8217;s UCORE designation, please communicate this in email to the committee chair, Clif Stratton, at <a href="mailto:clif.stratton@wsu.edu">clif.stratton@wsu.edu</a> as soon as you know.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If a course is up for renewal in Fall semester, submit the renewal package by December 1. The UCORE committee will review the package no later than the end of the subsequent Spring semester.</li>
					<li>If a course is up for renewal in Spring semester, submit the renewal package by April 1. The UCORE committee will review the package no later than the end of the subsequent Fall semester.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If the renewal package is submitted on time but upon committee review does not ultimately satisfy the learning outcomes for the particular UCORE designation, the course&#8217;s UCORE status will drop two semesters after the committee&#8217;s notification of decision. For example, a course reviewed by the committee in Spring semester would drop its UCORE status the following Spring semester.</p>
