			<h2>Proposing New UCORE Courses</h2>
			<p>*Following these steps if you are requesting UCORE designation for either a brand new course (never taught) or an existing WSU course (currently taught).</p>
			<p>For each of WSU&#8217;s baccalaureate students, the UCORE component of their degree provides the breadth of learning that complements more focused study within the major. The balance of breadth and depth in every degree reflects the recognition that effective leaders in all fields of work draw on a breadth of knowledge and skills from a variety of disciplines. In addition, UCORE courses merit particular attention for several other reasons. UCORE courses may comprise a student&#8217;s full course load in their first semester or first year at the university. In many cases, the particular UCORE course that a student takes in a given designation will be the only college-level course taken from that disciplinary perspective. For these non-majors, UCORE courses not only introduce students to the specific topic of a given course but also to the modes of inquiry, evidence, and critical thought that govern the wider disciplinary arena. Ultimately, all UCORE classes should focus clearly on the development of student learning, especially the cultivation of transferable skills, including but not limited to communication, information literacy, and critical thinking. Courses should enhance the knowledge, skills, and abilities as articulated in the WSU Learning Goals and Outcomes, which encourage the development of lifelong learning skills of integrating and synthesizing concepts in order to solve real problems.</p>

			<div class="toggled-panel">
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Getting started</strong> (for department chairs/undergraduate studies committee chairs/faculty involved in teaching the course):
						<ol class="sv--0mx" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
							<li><strong>Review the current <a href="https://ucore.wsu.edu/faculty/resources/handbook/">UCORE Handbook</a></strong> for updated information about the Learning Outcomes for the course’s intended UCORE designator and other elements needed for UCORE courses/syllabi. Identify specific outcomes that the course fulfills. Note that each designator has specific sets of required outcomes.</li>
							<li><strong>Communicate with department faculty or staff</strong> to determine (1) who has been teaching this course (if previously taught without UCORE designation) in recent years and (2) how syllabi and expectations are communicated to instructors.</li>
							<li><strong>Determine whose responsibility</strong> it will be to collect and prepare proposal materials.</li>
							<li><strong>Communicate submission deadlines</strong> and other relevant information and/or materials as necessary.</li>
							<li><strong>Department chairs should review and sign off</strong> on new course request materials before faculty member completes new course request form (see step 3 below).</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Preparing materials</strong> (for undergraduate studies committees/faculty):
						<ol class="sv--0mx" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
							<li><strong>Review the current <a href="https://ucore.wsu.edu/faculty/resources/handbook/">UCORE Handbook</a></strong> for updated information about the Learning Outcomes for the course’s intended UCORE designator and other elements needed for UCORE courses/syllabi. Identify specific outcomes that the course fulfills. Note that each designator has specific sets of required outcomes.</li>
							<li><strong>Communicate with other instructors across all sections on all campuses</strong> where the course is currently offered (if course is not entirely new) to collect recent syllabi and representative assignment prompts that fulfill the Learning Outcomes for the course’s UCORE designator.</li>
							<li>For multi-section and/or multi-campus courses, <strong>form a steering committee or regular working group of faculty (if not already in place) involved in the course to ensure consistency and communication of learning outcomes</strong>. Expectations are that UCORE learning outcomes and the means to achieve them are apparent and similar across all sections and campuses, but that faculty may adopt varied assigned readings, assignments, topics, activities, etc as they see fit. Consider the extent to which syllabi and assignments are in sync to advance the UCORE learning outcomes <em>before the course is submitted for UCORE designation</em>. Reconcile any divergences before submitting the new UCORE course request. Moving forward, all faculty that may teach the course in the future will have a clear sense of the expectations.</li>
							<li><strong>Develop a master syllabus</strong> that includes (1) <a href="http://ucore.wsu.edu/documents/2019/05/adaptable_ucore_syllabus_language.docx">clear language</a> about the course&#8217;s place within and value of UCORE to students&#8217; undergraduate experience, (2) a completed Learning Outcomes Grid for this course (see <a href="http://ucore.wsu.edu/documents/2019/02/sampleucoresyllabusfall2019.pdf"><span style="color: #0000ff">sample UCORE syllabus</span></a>), and (3) up-to-date required components per WSU&#8217;s <a href="/documents/2018/08/syllabus-components-checklist_from-wsu-vpue_2018.pdf"><em>Syllabus Checklist</em></a>. Be clear throughout the syllabus, including in the Learing Outcomes grid, how assignments and activities advance the required learning outcomes. A completed Learning Outcomes Grid is required in the syllabus for any course seeking UCORE designation. Grids for each designator can be downloaded, completed, and inserted as follows: [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_arts.docx">ARTS</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_bsci.docx">BSCI</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_caps.docx">CAPS</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_comm.docx">COMM</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_divr.docx">DIVR</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_hum.docx">HUM</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_psci.docx">PSCI</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_quan.docx">QUAN</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_ssci.docx">SSCI</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_wrtg.docx">WRTG</a>].

							<li><strong>Select a representative assignment prompt or prompts</strong> to include in the new course request. In some cases, key assignment prompts and assignment descriptions in syllabi will require revision from previous iterations if the course has been taught in the past. Be sure that the prompt or prompts collectively address all required learning outcomes for the course&#8217;s UCORE designation. Consult the Office of Assessment of Teaching and Learning&#8217;s <a href="https://atl.wsu.edu/assignment-design/">Assignment Design </a>webpage for assistance.</li>
							<li>After approval, <strong>share the final new course request package with all instructors</strong> currently or potentially teaching the course. Use it as a training or orientation tool for any instructors teaching the course in the future.</li>

		<h2>Renewing UCORE Courses</h2>
		<p>All courses that hold UCORE designation undergo periodic renewal to ensure that they continue to meet general education learning outcomes at WSU. The UCORE committee periodically revises UCORE Learning Outcomes based on latest national best practices, assessment data, university policy initiatives, and other criteria. Therefore, departments seeking renewal should carefully adhere to the following steps to ensure that courses successfully renew UCORE status. Recognizing that courses evolve over time, your department is welcome to request renewal of the course under a different UCORE designator, if you find that is a better fit.</p>
		<p>After a pilot renewal process involving five courses in AY 2018-19, a four-year process of renewal of UCORE courses will commence in Fall 2019 and conclude in Fall 2023. Any course approved for UCORE designation before AY 2018-19 will undergo renewal during this period. See the <a href="http://ucore.wsu.edu/documents/2019/02/ucore-renewal-schedule-prefix-view.pdf">UCORE renewal schedule</a>.</p>

						<li><strong><a href="http://ucore.wsu.edu/documents/2019/05/adaptable_ucore_syllabus_language.docx">Clear language</a> about the course&#8217;s place within UCORE,</strong> including how the course fulfills learning outcomes for its specific UCORE designation and value of UCORE to students&#8217; undergraduate experience. For instance, the syllabus for a Diversity [DIVR] course should clearly address how the course helps students move beyond perception-based comparisons, understand how power, privilege, stereotypes are constructed and sustained, etc. Social Science [SSCI] syllabi should not only address how the course fulfills disciplinary learning outcomes, but does so within the context of UCORE&#8217;s [SSCI] requirements, including the use of quantitative reasoning. The <a href="https://ucore.wsu.edu/faculty/resources/handbook/">UCORE Handbook</a> contains required elements for each UCORE designation. For sample UCORE syllabus language, consult this <a href="http://ucore.wsu.edu/documents/2019/05/adaptable_ucore_syllabus_language.docx">adaptable UCORE syllabus language document</a>.</li>
						<li><strong>A completed Learning Outcomes Grid</strong> for the course’s specified UCORE designation that explicitly spells out which UCORE course, and (if applicable) program learning goals the course will advance. To “advance” a student toward a learning goal means that by the end of the course, each student that passes the course will have a greater ability, as specified by the learning goal, than the student had when beginning the course. Students should have practice with feedback in order to improve their ability. Grids for each designator can be downloaded, completed, and inserted as follows: [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_arts.docx">ARTS</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_bsci.docx">BSCI</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_caps.docx">CAPS</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_comm.docx">COMM</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_divr.docx">DIVR</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_hum.docx">HUM</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_psci.docx">PSCI</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_quan.docx">QUAN</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_ssci.docx">SSCI</a>] [<a href="/documents/2018/10/learning-outcomes-grid_wrtg.docx">WRTG</a>]</li>

		<h3 id="renewal-submission-deadlines" class="drop-down-toggle boxed">Renewal Submission Deadlines</h3>
		<div class="toggled-panel">
			<p>The UCORE Committee has organized the first round of renewals to take place over four years from Fall 2019 through Spring 2023. Renewal will take place in the approximate order in which courses were originally approved.</p>
			<p>Consult the <a href="http://ucore.wsu.edu/documents/2019/02/ucore-renewal-schedule-prefix-view.pdf">UCORE renewal schedule</a> to see when to submit specific courses for renewal. Courses that are not submitted by the deadline listed in the renewal schedule will lose UCORE status within two semesters. For example, a course not submitted by Fall deadline would not hold UCORE designation beginning the following Fall semester. </p>
			<p>***If you do <i>not</i> intend to seek UCORE status renewal for a particular course, so long as nothing else about the course is changing, please promptly complete a <a href="https://ucorewsu.sharedwork.com/requests/0309377136">Drop UCORE Designation Request Form</a>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If a course is up for renewal in Fall semester, submit the renewal package by December 1. The UCORE committee will review the package no later than the end of the subsequent Spring semester.</li>
				<li>If a course is up for renewal in Spring semester, submit the renewal package by April 1. The UCORE committee will review the package no later than the end of the subsequent Fall semester.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If the renewal package is submitted on time but upon committee review does not ultimately satisfy the learning outcomes for the particular UCORE designation, the course&#8217;s UCORE status will drop two semesters after the committee&#8217;s notification of decision. For example, a course reviewed by the committee in Spring semester would drop its UCORE status the following Spring semester.</p>
