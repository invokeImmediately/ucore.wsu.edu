<dl class="faq toggled blue">
	<dt>Who in my department prepares and submits the proposal for a new UCORE course — the instructor(s), chair or someone else?</dt>
	<dd>
		<p><strong>An instructor or chair may initiate a course proposal on their own, or at the request of the college.</strong> However, before the proposal is forwarded to the UCORE committee, both the chair and associate dean must sign the proposal. Also, keep in mind that only one proposal can be submitted per course (e.g., DEPT 101), even if that course has multiple sections with multiple instructors. Thus, any instructor in such a situation should confer with her or his chair before beginning a UCORE course proposal.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>If every instructor offers a different version of a common course, e.g., DEPT 101, should we submit a syllabus for every section?</dt>
	<dd>
		<p><strong>Only one syllabus per course number is to be submitted.</strong> That syllabus should contain the core outcomes across all sections, key graded assignments for all sections, common content, and common assessments across sections. If there is such divergence across sections that these commonalities are difficult to find, perhaps new courses should be proposed.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Why are deadlines for UCORE course proposals so far in advance of the course offerings?</dt>
	<dd>
		<p><strong>Because of the number of stakeholders involved, considerable time is required to evaluate the proposal.</strong> Every UCORE course approval (i.e., process by which a course receives a UCORE designator, such as “HUM” and “BSCI”) goes through several committees: the University Common Requirements Committee, the Catalog Subcommittee, the Academic Affairs Subcommittee, and then finally, the Faculty Senate. Moreover, every course seeking permanent approval must appear in the catalog and schedule of classes before registration opens for the first term in which the course is to be taught. Thus, course proposals must be submitted months in advance of when the course will first be taught.</p>
		<p>For example, Fall 20XZ courses need to be in the catalog for pre-registration advising, which occurs in March 20XZ. To meet this March deadline, a course proposal must enter the Faculty Senate final docket no later than February 1, which requires that it clear three Senate subcommittees before winter break—hence the October 15, 20XY deadline.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Why is so much detail needed in a UCORE course proposal?</dt>
	<dd>
		<p><strong>University learning goals are the central feature and raison d’être of University Common Requirements;</strong> therefore, the proposal must be clear about how the proposed course will <em>advance</em> students toward the learning goals assigned to the course. To “advance” means not merely to cover or address learning goals, but to design the course such that all students (who pass the course) will improve noticeably on the skills and knowledge specified in the learning goal. Thus, the proposal must contain enough detail so that it is clear to the UCORE committee that such advancement likely will happen.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>I'm trying to work on a UCORE course proposal, and I don’t understand what the directions are really asking for. Whom can I talk to for help?</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Your college UCORE representative as <a href="/faculty/committees/" target="_blank">listed on the people and sucommittees page</a> may be able to help you. Your departmental assessment lead may also be able to help you articulate the interrelation of the course goals, key graded assignments, and assessment of student mastery of the goals. In addition, those in your department that have already obtained UCORE approval for a course may be a resource for you in the revision</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Do UCORE course approvals ever expire?</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Courses naturally evolve over time; similarly, the UCORE criteria themselves will evolve in response to University assessment efforts. Good practice dictates that UCORE courses be reviewed periodically to ensure continued alignment with UCORE outcomes and criteria.</p>
		<p>Initial approval begins a five-year review cycle that will be conducted by either the UCORE Committee or a new subcommittee thereof. Departments will be notified of the upcoming review during the prior academic year. Thus, for courses approved in AY 20XA-XB, notification of review will be given in 20XE-XF for a review in 20XF-XG.</p>
