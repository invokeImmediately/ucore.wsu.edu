<p class="article-tagline">Advisors: you are the main connection with students!</p>
<p><strong>If you are an advisor looking for information on UCORE,</strong> you may find information in the <a href="/students/">“For Students”</a> section of these UCORE pages useful to you. Below we hope to address your questions about UCORE.</p>
<dl class="faq toggled">
	<dt>What is UCORE?</dt>
	<dd><p>UCORE is WSU’s general education requirements. All students entering WSU as freshmen or undergraduate transfer students must satisfy these requirements.</p></dd>
	<dt>How can I help students to be more enthusiastic about the UCORE requirements that they should take?</dt>
	<dd><p>UCORE confers numerous benefits of interest to students. UCORE classes can be fun and there are lots of classes to choose from. Moreover, UCORE courses give students the opportunity to explore interests outside of their major. UCORE ensures students will graduate with attributes appropriate for a university–educated person. Students will learn how to approach important questions from a variety of perspectives, a skill which is of value regardless of major.</p>
	<p>Perhaps more to the point for students is that their future employers actually do care about these things. Future employers want students who are well rounded and well educated. Please <a href="/#general-education-quotes">read the quotes</a> from former Chairman and CEO of the Lockheed Martin Corporation and David Kearns of Xerox on the UCORE home page.</p></dd>
	<dt>Where can I find the UCORE graduation requirements?</dt>
	<dd><p>Check out the WSU Graduation Requirements in the WSU catalog or in the student section of this site.</p></dd>
	<dt>What courses can students use to fulfill the UCORE requirements?</dt>
	<dd><p>You can find a <a href="/students/categories-and-courses/">UCORE Course List</a> in the student section of these webpages. In addition, you can search by UCORE category for UCORE classes offered in any one semester in the Office of the Registrar's <a href="http://schedules.wsu.edu/Search" target="_blank">“Search the Schedules”</a> page.</p></dd>
	<dt>What about transfer students?</dt>
	<dd><p>The direct transfer associate's degree (DTA) will satisfy all the requirements except for the Integrative Capstone [CAPS]. Students who transfer without a degree would meet requirements through course-by-course matches, as they do currently. Upper division programs that require specific courses as prerequisites to the major may need to develop more explicit advising pathways for prospective students, so that they take the appropriate course at the community college as part of the DTA.</p></dd>
	<dd><p>Associate of Science Transfer (AST) degree holders (Track 1 and Track 2) have always had additional general education requirements to meet. With UCORE, AST holders must complete HISTORY 105, Roots of Contemporary Issues [ROOT], a second Communication course (either [COMM] or [WRTG]), the Diversity requirement [DIVR], and the Integrative Capstone [CAPS]. Thus, for AST degree holders, a total of four UCORE courses need to be completed at WSU.</p></dd>
	<dt>What if my department has specific UCORE requirements?</dt>
	<dd><p>Many majors require specific courses for some of the UCORE categories. For example, Calculus is typically a required [QUAN] course for science and engineering majors. In these cases, students need to take the UCORE course required by their major.</p></dd>
	<dt>How many UCORE courses can be taken within the major?</dt>
	<dd><p>Under UCORE, students will be able to complete up to three (3- or 4-credit) UCORE requirements with­in their chosen major. (For the purpose of this limitation, three 1-credit courses may be combined to count for a single 3-credit course.) This will allow students, as an example, to use Sociology 101 to fulfill a [SSCI] as well as a requirement within the major.</p></dd>
	<dt>How do UCORE courses relate to the WSU Learning Goals and Outcomes?</dt>
	<dd><p>Courses in the UCORE curriculum are explicitly designed to engage students in meeting these goals.</p></dd>
	<dt>How do I know whether or not a course meets a UCORE requirement?</dt>
	<dd><p>UCORE classes are all identified by a bracketed three- or four-letter abbreviation in the catalog as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong><code>[ROOT]</code></strong> = Roots of Contemporary Issues</li>
		<li><strong><code>[QUAN]</code></strong> = Quantitative Reasoning</li>
		<li><strong><code>[WRTG]</code></strong> = Written Communication</li>
		<li><strong><code>[COMM]</code></strong> = Communication</li>
		<li><strong><code>[SSCI]</code></strong> = Inquiry in the Social Sciences</li>
		<li><strong><code>[HUM]</code></strong> = Inquiry in the Humanities</li>
		<li><strong><code>[ARTS]</code></strong> = Inquiry in the Creative and Professional Arts</li>
		<li><strong><code>[BSCI]</code></strong>, <strong><code>[PSCI]</code></strong>, <strong><code>[SCI]</code></strong> = Inquiry in the Natural Sciences</li>
		<li><strong><code>[DIVR]</code></strong> = Diversity</li>
		<li><strong><code>[CAPS]</code></strong> = Integrative Capstone</li>
	</ul></dd>
