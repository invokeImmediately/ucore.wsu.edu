Additionally, UCORE includes foundational courses, inquiry-based learning courses in the disciplines, and a diversity course requirement. See the <a href=\"https:\/\/ucore.wsu.edu\/\">UCORE website<\/a> for more information.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cResults from NSSE help faculty and administration understand more about our students\u2019 learning experiences and their perceptions of the educational opportunities WSU offers its undergraduates, particularly in relation to WSU\u2019s Learning Goals of Undergraduate Education,\u201d said UCORE Director Clif Stratton.\u00a0 \u201cWe will be looking at NSSE results in combination with other assessments of first year students and seniors, as we consider the UCORE curriculum and make recommendations about faculty development initiatives and course design.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/nsse.indiana.edu\/\">National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE)<\/a>\u00a0annually collects information at hundreds of four-year colleges and universities about first-year and senior student participation in activities and programs that promote their learning and personal development.\u00a0NSSE assesses the extent to which students engage in educational practices associated with high levels of learning and development. At WSU, NSSE is offered to all first-year and senior students on all WSU campuses every other spring. With the census administration, students are recruited via email (i.e., students receive a survey invitation and reminders by email).\u00a0The\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/atl.wsu.edu\/\">Office of Assessment of Teaching and Learning (ATL)<\/a>, in collaboration with the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/ir.wsu.edu\/\">Office of Institutional Research (IR)<\/a>, coordinates the administration of NSSE at WSU.<\/p>\n<p>In 2019, 1,427 seniors and 1,198 first-year students responded to the survey at WSU. The WSU response rate was 24% for seniors and 26% for first-year students, compared to the average national response rate of 21% for participating institutions with undergraduate enrollments of 10,000 or more.<\/p>\n<p>For additional information, see UCORE\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/ucore.wsu.edu\/assessment\/key-assessments\/nsse\/\">National Survey of Student Engagement Key Assessment<\/a>\u00a0page.<\/p>\n", "protected": false
